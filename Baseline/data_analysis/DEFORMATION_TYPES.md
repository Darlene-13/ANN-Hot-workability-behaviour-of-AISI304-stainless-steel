# 🧱 TYPES OF DEFORMATION AND STRESS–STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS

---

## 1. BASED ON MATERIAL RESPONSE

### **a. Elastic Deformation**
- **Definition:** Temporary deformation; material returns to its original shape when load is removed.  
- **Stress–Strain Relationship:**  
  \[
  \sigma = E \varepsilon
  \]
  - Linear relationship (Hooke’s Law)  
  - \(E\): Young’s modulus (material stiffness)
- **Example:** Slight stretch of a spring or a metal wire within elastic limit.

---

### **b. Plastic Deformation**
- **Definition:** Permanent deformation; material does not return to its original shape after unloading.  
- **Stress–Strain Relationship:**  
  - Nonlinear beyond yield point.  
  - Initially: \( \sigma = E \varepsilon \) (elastic region)  
  - After yield: stress increases slowly with strain due to work hardening:
    \[
    \sigma = K \varepsilon^n
    \]
    where \(K\) = strength coefficient, \(n\) = strain hardening exponent.
- **Example:** Bending a paper clip permanently.

---

### **c. Fracture (Failure)**
- **Definition:** Material breaks after excessive strain or stress beyond ultimate tensile strength.  
- **Stress–Strain Relationship:**
  - Rapid drop in stress after the necking point.
  - Final failure occurs when internal stress exceeds material cohesion.
- **Example:** Breaking of a brittle glass rod or ductile metal after excessive stretching.

---

## 2. BASED ON TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS

### **a. Cold Deformation**
- **Definition:** Deformation below the recrystallization temperature.  
- **Stress–Strain Relationship:**
  - High stress required to deform.
  - Stress increases with strain due to work hardening.
  - Typical curve: rising stress with strain.
- **Example:** Cold rolling or bending at room temperature.

---

### **b. Warm Deformation**
- **Definition:** Deformation at intermediate temperatures (around 0.3–0.5 of melting temperature).  
- **Stress–Strain Relationship:**
  - Moderate stress required.
  - Partial recovery of dislocations.
  - Smoother curve, lower stress than cold working.
- **Example:** Forming metals around 400–700°C (for steels).

---

### **c. Hot Deformation**
- **Definition:** Deformation above recrystallization temperature.  
- **Stress–Strain Relationship:**
  - At low strain → high stress (material initially resists).
  - As strain increases → stress decreases (flow softening due to dynamic recovery/recrystallization).
  - Typical relationship: **Low strain → High stress; High strain → Low stress**.
- **Example:** Hot forging, extrusion, or rolling of steel at red heat.

## 3. BASED ON MODE OF LOADING

| **Mode** | **Definition** | **Stress–Strain Relationship** | **Example** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **Tensile** | Pulling apart | Stress increases with elongation until failure | Stretching a metal rod |
| **Compressive** | Pushing together | Stress compresses material; strain is negative | Compression of a column |
| **Shear** | Sliding of layers | Shear stress (τ) vs. shear strain (γ): \( τ = Gγ \) in elastic range | Scissors cutting paper |
| **Torsional** | Twisting motion | Shear stress proportional to twist angle (within elastic range) | Turning a screwdriver shaft |
| **Bending** | Combination of tension and compression | Stress varies linearly along beam cross-section | Bending a beam or ruler |

---

## 4. BASED ON TIME DEPENDENCE

| **Type** | **Definition** | **Stress–Strain Relationship** | **Example** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| **Instantaneous** | Immediate deformation under load | Linear (Hooke’s Law) | Elastic stretching |
| **Viscoelastic** | Time-dependent deformation and recovery | Combination of elastic and viscous components: \( \sigma = E \varepsilon + \eta \frac{d\varepsilon}{dt} \) | Polymers, rubbers |
| **Creep** | Slow, continuous deformation under constant stress at high T | Strain increases with time even at constant stress | Turbine blades, steam pipes |
| **Fatigue** | Progressive damage due to cyclic loading | Stress amplitude–strain relationship defines endurance limit | Aircraft wings, rotating shafts |

---

## 5. SUMMARY OVERVIEW

| **Category** | **Type** | **Typical Stress–Strain Behavior** |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Material Response | Elastic | Linear; reversible deformation |
|  | Plastic | Nonlinear; permanent deformation |
|  | Fracture | Sudden stress drop; failure |
| Temperature | Cold | High stress; work hardening |
|  | Warm | Moderate stress; partial recovery |
|  | Hot | Low stress at high strain; softening |
| Load Mode | Tensile / Compressive / Shear / Torsion / Bending | Direction-dependent; varies per mode |
| Time Dependence | Instantaneous / Creep / Fatigue / Viscoelastic | Time- or cycle-dependent deformation |

### 🧠 **Key Insight**

> The **stress–strain relationship** depends not just on material type but also on **temperature**, **strain rate**, **loading mode**, and **time**.  
> For hot deformation processes (like hot working of AISI 304), the relationship typically follows:  
> **Low strain → High stress** and **High strain → Low stress**, due to dynamic recovery and recrystallization.
